I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/) in 2020, and will join [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) as a master student in spring 2021.

Currently I am a research intern in ByteDance AI Lab supervised by [Dr. Hang Li](https://www.hangli-hl.com/index.html), and I am working on text generation research.

I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research; more specifically, I am interested in text generation and knowledge-aware NLP.
