I am an undergraduate from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), majoring in electrical engineering and informatics, and will graduate in June 2020. I will join the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) as an MSCS student in fall 2020 (but due to the COVID-19 epidemic, it is possible to postpone enrollment until spring 2021).

Currently I am a research intern in the Machine Learning Group, Microsoft Research Asia supervised by Dr. Tao Qin, and I am working on machine translation.

**Looking for job!** I am looking for a research intern position in the industry from July 2020 to December 2020.
My research interests include text generation and knowledge-aware NLP.
