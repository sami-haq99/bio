I am a senior undergraduate at the University of Science and Technology, and I major in the Electrical Engineering and Information Science.

I plan to join a graduate program in computer science in the fall of 2020. My main research interests are Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. I am also interested in other areas of AI, such as Data Mining and Computer Vision.

After graduation, I plan to join the industry, e.g. by leading a research lab, and develop NLP technology with real-world applications and positive social impacts.
