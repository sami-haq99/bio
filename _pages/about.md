I am a M.S. student in computer science in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) working with Prof. Heng Ji since 08/2021.

Prior to that, I got my B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2020, and I have work experience in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and Bytedance AI Lab.

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially text generation, information extraction, and knowledge-aware NLP.

**I am looking for NLP research (preferred) or engineer internship opportunities for summer 2022.**
