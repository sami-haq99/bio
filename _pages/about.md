I am a M.S. student in computer science in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) from fall 2021. Previously I graduated from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2020, and I have work experience in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and Bytedance AI Lab. I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially text generation and knowledge-aware NLP.
