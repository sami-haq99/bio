*This is not an exhaustive list of my research projects. In this page, I have tried to highlight some of the interesting projects that I have worked on in the past few years.*
# **1. MODAIS**
In my master’ thesis research work, I examined the use of model driven software engineering for design and analysis of physical security systems. In my research, I developed a framework to support the modeling of physical infrastructures in the form of a platform independent model using Unified Modeling Language (UML). Furthermore, the transformation engine was developed to generate quantitative models based on Bayesian Network from UML models to perform validation.

The faramework supports rich modeling concepts for physical infrastructure security with extension of UML.

A real-world casestudy was implemented to evaluate the framework.

# **2. Reverse Engineering UML (Static and Dynamic) Models from Java Source Code**
We proposed a novel MDRE framework named as ‘‘Source to Model Framework (Src2MoF)’’ to generate Unified Modeling Language (UML) structural (class) and behavioral (activity) diagrams from the Java source code. Src2MoF is based on the principles of Model Driven Engineering (MDE), which use models as first-class citizens alleviating the complexity of software systems.

Transformation rules were defined to transform the code units of java source code to UML structures.
