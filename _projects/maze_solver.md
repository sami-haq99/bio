excerpt: "This project is for the Electronic Design Practice II course and the **Electronic Design Contest of USTC**, and won the **third prize** in the competition. We built a robot to solve a maze composed of black lines on a white background. We used the STM32 microprocessor as the main controller of the robot. We used a camera to identify the map, implemented the DIP algorithm to ensure motion stability, and employed the BFS algorithm to search the map and to solve the maze."

This project is for the Electronic Design Practice II course and the **Electronic Design Contest of USTC**, and won the **third prize** in the competition.

We built a robot to solve a maze composed of black lines on a white background. We used the STM32 microprocessor as the main controller of the robot. We used a camera to identify the map, implemented the DIP algorithm to ensure motion stability, and employed the BFS algorithm to search the map and to solve the maze.

Our team is a four-person team. I was the main programmer and contributed most of the code.
