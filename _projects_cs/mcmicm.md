excerpt: "The project is for **MCM/ICM** competition and earned the title of **Meritorious Winner**. We employed cellular automata to build a high-resolution model of Louvre, and simulated the basic evacuation strategy with high accuracy. On this basis, we proposed three improved evacuation strategies, including using additional exits, broadcasting via mobile apps, and emergency personnel strategies. We designed mathematical models for these strategies, and verified through extensive experiments and visualizations that they significantly improved evacuation efficiency."

The project is for **MCM/ICM** competition and earned the title of **Meritorious Winner**.

We employed cellular automata to build a high-resolution model of Louvre, and simulated the basic evacuation strategy with high accuracy. On this basis, we proposed three improved evacuation strategies, including using additional exits, broadcasting via mobile apps, and emergency personnel strategies. We designed mathematical models for these strategies, and verified through extensive experiments and visualizations that they significantly improved evacuation efficiency.

Our team consists of three people, and I am the team leader and the main programmer. I also participated in mathematical modeling and dissertation writing. This is our team:
