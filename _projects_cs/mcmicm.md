permalink: /projects/cs/mcmicm
excerpt: "The project is for MCM/ICM competition and earned the title of Meritorious Winner. We employed cellular automata models to build high-resolution Louvre models and simulated the basic evacution strategy with high accuracy. On this basis, we proposed three additional strategies, including using additional exits, using mobile applications to design and guide global evacuation strategies, and emergency personnel strategies. We designed mathematical models for these strategies, and conducted detailed experiments and visualizations to verify that they significantly improved evacuation efficiency."

The project is for **MCM/ICM** competition and earned the title of **Meritorious Winner**. We employed cellular automata models to build high-resolution Louvre models and simulated the basic evacution strategy with high accuracy. On this basis, we proposed three additional strategies, including using additional exits, using mobile applications to design and guide global evacuation strategies, and emergency personnel strategies. We designed mathematical models for these strategies, and conducted detailed experiments and visualizations to verify that they significantly improved evacuation efficiency.
