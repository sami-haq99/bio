This project is for the Modern Software Engineering course and earned most of us a grade of A+. We were a team of seven people, and we built an Android app for Diary writing and emotion tracking. Our users can track mood changes using "emotion tags" in each diary and view their statistics. All data is encrypted and synchronized regularly.

This is our [github repo](https://github.com/shirley-wu/HeartTrace), and if you are interested in our development process, please read our [team blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/USTC-CC/) (in Chinese).

In this project, I was the team leader and a member of backend group.
I was responsible for Android database management and encryption, network communication (such as user registration and login), and data synchronization on the Android side.
