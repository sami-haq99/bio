excerpt: "This project is for the Modern Software Engineering course and earned most of us a grade of A+. We built an Android app for Diary writing and emotion tracking. Our users can track their moods using \"emotion tags\" in each diary and view their statistics. All data is encrypted and synchronized regularly. Our final app is both user-friendly and efficient, which has won us dozens of loyal users. Our project was rated the best team project by the instructor."

This project is for the Modern Software Engineering course and earned most of us a grade of A+. We built an Android app for Diary writing and emotion tracking. Our users can track their moods using "emotion tags" in each diary and view their statistics. All data is encrypted and synchronized regularly. Our final app is both user-friendly and efficient, which has won us dozens of loyal users. Our project was rated the best team project by the instructor.

This is our [github repo](https://github.com/shirley-wu/HeartTrace), and if you are interested in our development process, please read our [team blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/USTC-CC/) (in Chinese).

Our team was consisted of seven people and two groups, the backend group and the frontend group. I was the team leader and a member of backend group.
I was responsible for Android database management and encryption, network communication (such as user registration and login), and data synchronization on the Android side.

### Modern Software Engineering

We managed the program development based on modern software engineering principles. Our development includes three phases: requirements analysis and product design (March to April), alpha sprint (May to June) and beta sprint (July to August).

We divided the team into two groups: back-end group and front-end group. In each group, members were further divided into several sub-groups according to their specific tasks. We held scrum meetings once a week, and each group held informal meetings two or three times a week to promote collaboration.

We also utilized modern software engineering techniques including taskboard and burndown to track our development. This is an example of our taskboard:
