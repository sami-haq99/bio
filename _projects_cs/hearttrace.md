This project is for the Modern Software Engineering course and earned most of us a grade of A+. We built an Android app for Diary writing and emotion tracking. Our users can track their moods using "emotion tags" in each diary and view their statistics. All data is encrypted and synchronized regularly. Our final app is both user-friendly and efficient, which has won us dozens of loyal users. Our project was rated the best team project by the instructor.

This is our [github repo](https://github.com/shirley-wu/HeartTrace), and if you are interested in our development process, please read our [team blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/USTC-CC/) (in Chinese).

Our team was consisted of seven people and two groups, the backend group and the frontend group. I was the team leader and a member of backend group.
I was responsible for Android database management and encryption, network communication (such as user registration and login), and data synchronization on the Android side.
