excerpt: "In 2017 I participated the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), Software Track as a menmber of USTC-Software. We built a website, Biohub v2.0, a synthetic biology community, with a search engine to provide efficient Biobricks (DNA sequences) information retrieval and a pertinent forum to promote convenient biological ideas sharing. It is also a flexible plugin system which allows users to develop new functions and integrated them into the platform. Our project won the medal prize in the competition."
