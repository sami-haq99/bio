This project is for the International Genetically Engineered Machine (**iGEM**) Competition (Software Track), and won the **medal prize**.

We built a website called Biohub v2.0 to provide a synthetic biology community. We provided an efficient search engine for Biobricks (DNA sequences), a BioBrick scoring system, and a pertinent forum to promote idea sharing. It is also a flexible plugin system which allows users to develop new functions and integrated them into the platform.

For the detail of our project, please refer to our [wiki](http://2017.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software) page. This is our [github repo](https://github.com/igemsoftware2017/USTC-Software-2017) if you are interested in our source code.

In this project, I was a member of backend group and was responsible for building the search engine, BioSearch. I also participated in the design and implementation of BioSearch plugin.
