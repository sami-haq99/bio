This project is for **[Challenge-2019 on Object Detection in Aerial Images](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOAI2019/challenge.html)** held by CVPR, and won the **first place** in task 1 and the **second place** in task 2, and resulted in a paper ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09447)) (currently under review by IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing) with me as the second author.

Based on the periodicity of the tilt angle, we proposed Adaptive Period Embedding (APE), an improved oriented object representation method To handle the existence of arbitrarily oriented objects. Compared to previous methods, our representation makes the model much easier to train. Additionally, we proposed Length Independent IoU (LIIoU) to increase the recall for long objects that are common in aerial images. Our method greatly outperforms others on oriented object detection task (task 1) as shown in the leaderboard: (our team is named USTC-NELSLIP)

Our team consisted of three people, me, Yixing Zhu (a master candidate) and Prof. Jun Du (our supervisor and the head of [NEL-SLIP SPART](<http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jundu/The%20team.html>)). Below are our award certificates:
