excerpt: "This project aims to compare three different models (DNN-HMM, CTC and encoder-decoder) for Chinese Handwritten Textline Recognition task. I conducted extensive experiments to compare these three basic models. To improve performance and establish stronger baselines, I featured a data augmentation method using images of isolated words and a large Chinese corpus to construct textline images. Inspired by CRNN, I improved the CTC architecture and increased the accuracy from 80.1% to 87.3%."

This project aims to compare three different models (DNN-HMM, CTC and encoder-decoder) for Chinese Handwritten Textline Recognition task.

I conducted extensive experiments to compare these three basic models. To improve performance and establish stronger baselines, I featured a data augmentation method using images of isolated words and a large Chinese corpus to construct textline images. Inspired by CRNN, I improved the CTC architecture and increased the accuracy from 80.1% to 87.3%. Below is an example of the constructed textline image:

I'm afraid I cannot release all the technical details due to lab regulations.

This project is led by me and supervised by Dr. Zirui Wang and Prof. Jun Du. Actually, this is the first research project totally led by me. Many thanks to Zirui and Jun who have helped me a looooot during this process!
