excerpt: "This project is for Robogame, a robot design contest held by USTC, and won the first prize. Our robot is called Qibing (旗兵 in Chinese, meaning a flag soldier). Using OpenCV on Raspberry Pi, we were able to identify the color of the boxes and decide the moving strategy. We used STM32 as the movement controller and implemented PID control algorithm on STM32 to guarantee stable and high-speed movement. Finally, we employed UART devices for efficient and reliable communication between the Raspberry Pi and STM32."

This project is for **Robogame**, a robot design contest held by USTC, and won the **first prize**. Here is the [detailed rules](#rules) for this competitions.

Our robot is called Qibing (旗兵 in Chinese, meaning a flag soldier). Using OpenCV on Raspberry Pi, we were able to identify the color of the boxes and decide the moving strategy. We used STM32 as the movement controller and implemented PID control algorithm on STM32 to guarantee stable and high-speed movement. Finally, we employed UART devices for efficient and reliable communication between the Raspberry Pi and STM32.

Below is our robot. If you are interested in his stage performance, check the video of the [exhibition game](https://youtu.be/flF1CCWiBO4) (Qibing is on the red side, i.e. on the right side of the stage).

Our team consists of five people. I was responsible for algorithm design, all STM32 programming and most Raspberry Pi programming. This is our team:

And this is our award certificate:
