excerpt: "This project is for National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest - Local Division TI Cup Race and won the second prize in Anhui province. We built an ammeter to measure a small alternating current in a non-contact manner. I implemented the FFT algorithm on STM32 to measure the frequency and amplitude of the signal, and employed bilinear interpolation to correct the nonlinear distortion of the amplitude caused by the sensor. After extensive experiments and careful calibrations, we managed to control the frequency error rate to within 0.5% and the amplitude rate error to within 2%."

This project is for **National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest - Local Division TI Cup Race** and won the **second prize** in Anhui province. We built an ammeter to measure a small alternating current in a non-contact manner. I implemented the FFT algorithm on STM32 to measure the frequency and amplitude of the signal, and employed bilinear interpolation to correct the nonlinear distortion of the amplitude caused by the sensor. After extensive experiments and careful calibrations, we managed to control the frequency error rate to within 0.5% and the amplitude rate error to within 2%.
